# Active Context: LeanTechCo React Website

## Current Phase
Testing phase is nearly complete. The website renders correctly and functions as expected. Ready for final optimizations and preparation for deployment.

## Active Tasks
1. Documenting testing results
2. Addressing npm vulnerabilities (where possible without breaking changes)
3. Preparing for additional browser testing

## Recent Decisions
1. Using React with minimal dependencies for better performance
2. Implementing TailwindCSS for styling instead of custom CSS
3. Creating a component-based architecture for better maintainability
4. Using placeholder images that will be replaced with actual client and product images
5. Creating responsive layouts that work on all device sizes
6. Documenting npm vulnerabilities rather than forcing fixes that would cause breaking changes

## Next Steps
1. Replace placeholder images with real assets
2. Test across additional browsers (Firefox, Safari, Edge)
3. Prepare for deployment
4. Create deployment documentation

## Current Considerations
1. **Performance**: The website loads quickly and renders smoothly
2. **Responsiveness**: The responsive design works well on all tested devices
3. **Maintainability**: The code structure is clean and well-organized
4. **Content Integrity**: Vietnamese content and brand messaging are preserved
5. **User Experience**: Smooth scrolling and intuitive navigation are working properly
6. **Security**: Some npm audit vulnerabilities exist in development dependencies, but don't affect the production build

## Technical Dependencies
1. React 18.2.0 - Core framework
2. TailwindCSS 3.3.0 - Styling
3. Font Awesome - Icons
4. Google Fonts (Inter) - Typography

## Development Environment
1. Node.js and npm for package management
2. Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
3. Local development server (npm start)
4. Browser developer tools for testing
