# LeanTechCo React Website Testing Notes

## Issues Found During Testing

### Dependency Issues
- npm audit reports 8 vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 6 high)
- These are deeply nested in dependencies and would require breaking changes to fix
- Since these are development dependencies, not affecting the production build, we've documented them but haven't forced fixes
- Created .npmrc file to set some resolution options, but deeper dependencies still have issues

### Environment Setup
- Installed all required dependencies
- Created assets directory for images
- Added placeholder favicon
- Development server running successfully
