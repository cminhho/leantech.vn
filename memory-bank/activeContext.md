# Active Context: LeanTechCo React Website

## Current Phase
Testing phase is nearly complete. The website renders correctly and functions as expected. Ready for final optimizations and preparation for deployment.

## Active Tasks
1. Documenting testing results
2. Addressing npm vulnerabilities (where possible without breaking changes)
3. Preparing for additional browser testing
4. Enhancing UI/UX of core components (recently completed Hero section and Header improvements)

## Recent Decisions
1. Using React with minimal dependencies for better performance
2. Implementing TailwindCSS for styling instead of custom CSS
3. Creating a component-based architecture for better maintainability
4. Using placeholder images that will be replaced with actual client and product images
5. Creating responsive layouts that work on all device sizes
6. Documenting npm vulnerabilities rather than forcing fixes that would cause breaking changes
7. Enhancing the Hero section with a professional, clean design:
   - Using video background with appropriate opacity
   - Restructuring content with bullet points and check icons
   - Moving stats section to bottom with divider
   - Removing unnecessary visual elements (wave divider, borders)
8. Making the Header transparent when at top of page, primary color when scrolled

## Next Steps
1. Replace placeholder images with real assets
2. Test across additional browsers (Firefox, Safari, Edge)
3. Prepare for deployment
4. Create deployment documentation

## Current Considerations
1. **Performance**: The website loads quickly and renders smoothly
2. **Responsiveness**: The responsive design works well on all tested devices
3. **Maintainability**: The code structure is clean and well-organized
4. **Content Integrity**: Vietnamese content and brand messaging are preserved
5. **User Experience**: Smooth scrolling and intuitive navigation are working properly
6. **Security**: Some npm audit vulnerabilities exist in development dependencies, but don't affect the production build
7. **Visual Hierarchy**: Improved through recent Hero section updates, focusing on clean professional look

## Technical Dependencies
1. React 18.2.0 - Core framework
2. TailwindCSS 3.3.0 - Styling
3. Font Awesome - Icons
4. Google Fonts (Inter) - Typography

## Development Environment
1. Node.js and npm for package management
2. Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
